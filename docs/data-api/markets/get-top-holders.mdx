<Note>
🟡 Holder rankings refresh every sync cycle. Expect a short delay between on-chain transfers and the leaderboard reflecting them.
</Note>

<code>{ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/holders</code> ranks wallets by token balance for the specified markets. Each entry bundles the token identifier plus an array of user records (proxy wallet, pseudonym, avatar, bio, balance, and outcome index).

## Query parameters

- `market` (required): CSV list of condition IDs. The API fetches top holders for each entry.
- `limit`: Number of holders per market (max 500).
- `minBalance`: Drop wallets below the provided token amount.

Because the output is grouped, you can feed it directly into “top holders” sections without additional reshaping.
