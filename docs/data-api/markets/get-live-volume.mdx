🟡 Totals update as new fills land in the cache, so very recent trades may take a few seconds to be reflected.

<code>GET {ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/live-volume?market=0xdd22472e552920b8438158ea7238bfadfa4f736aa4cee91a6b86c39ead110917,0x3ad2cfba08c4a214049f8f4c4c1e7f9a924b1332d604798b85a1afd7b9e884d3</code> aggregates collateral traded within a single event. The response contains the overall `total` plus a `markets` array that breaks the number out per condition ID.

Use it for dashboards that highlight the hottest events or for alerting tools that watch for sudden bursts of liquidity. The required `market` query expects a comma-separated list of condition IDs; pass every condition that belongs to the event to scope the snapshot correctly.
