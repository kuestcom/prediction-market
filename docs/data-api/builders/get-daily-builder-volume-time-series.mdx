<Note>
🔴 Daily builder volumes are placeholders until the attribution ETL is wired into production.
</Note>

<code>GET {ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/v1/builders/volume</code> spits out a day-by-day record for each builder, including the ISO timestamp (`dt`), volume, active user count, rank, and verification badge data.

Pick the time horizon with `timePeriod` (same values as the leaderboard endpoint). The route does not paginate because each day is a separate array entry, so scroll or aggregate as needed on the client.
