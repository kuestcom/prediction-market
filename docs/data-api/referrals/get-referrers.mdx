<code>GET {ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/referrers</code> returns aggregated fee totals (in USDC base units at fee charge time) for an address you treat as a referrer. Results are grouped by `exchange`, ordered by `updatedAt` (desc).

## Filters and pagination

- `address` is required and should be the receiver wallet.
- `exchange` scopes to a single CTFExchange/NegRisk address (lowercased).
- `tokenId` is optional. If provided, totals include only that token’s fees (converted to USDC at charge time). If omitted, totals aggregate all tokens and the response `tokenId` is `0`.
- `limit` defaults to 100 (max 500); `offset` defaults to 0.

## Amount semantics

- `totalAmount` is returned as raw USDC base units at fee charge time; divide by 1e6 for UI display.
- `totalVolume` is returned as raw USDC base units for executed trades that generated fees; divide by 1e6 for UI display.
- Empty results return `[]`.
