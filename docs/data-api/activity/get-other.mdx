openapi: 'GET /other'

export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Use <code>{ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/other</code> to fetch the aggregated converted balance for negative-risk augmented events. Provide the event `slug` plus the wallet address in `user` (proxy or EOA).

If the wallet has no conversions for the event (or the event is not eligible), the response is an empty array.

Response objects include:
- `slug`: event slug
- `user`: wallet address
- `size`: converted balance (shares)
