<Note>
🔴 Portfolio valuations depend on in-progress pricing feeds. Treat the returned USD numbers as indicative until pricing is finalized.

<code>GET {ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/value</code> summarizes the total USD-denominated exposure for a wallet. The response is intentionally compact—each object contains the `user` field and an aggregated `value` number—so you can poll it frequently.

- The `user` query parameter is required.
- Use the optional `market` CSV filter to limit the calculation to specific condition IDs (for example, when showing per-event drilldowns).

This route will eventually swap in FPMM-based mid prices; for now, it uses whatever cached marks are available.
