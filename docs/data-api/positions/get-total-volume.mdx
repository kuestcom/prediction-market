export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Use <code>{ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/volume</code> when you need the total notional volume for a wallet. The response echoes the `user` and a string `volume` so you can format the value without losing precision.

The total matches the user activity ledger and includes trades plus non-trade events such as splits, merges, redemptions, conversions, deposits, and withdrawals.
