<code>GET {ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/positions</code> returns every open claim held by a wallet, enriched with market metadata (titles, slugs, icons, and event slugs). The `user` query parameter is mandatory and must be an EVM address.

## Key filters

- Use `market` (CSV list of condition IDs) to scope down the response.
- Apply `sizeThreshold` to strip dust balances. It defaults to `1` so you can raise it for dashboards that only care about sizable exposure.
- Toggle `redeemable=true` or `mergeable=true` to surface lifecycle-specific positions.
- Use the `title` substring filter when you need fuzzy search against human-readable market names.

## Sorting and pagination

`limit` (max 500) and `offset` (max 10,000) implement simple pagination. Additional knobs:

- `sortBy`: choose between value-based fields (`CURRENT`, `TOKENS`, etc.) or descriptive ones like `TITLE` or `RESOLVING`.
- `sortDirection`: ascending or descending ordering.

The schema surfaces both unrealized (`cashPnl`, `percentPnl`) and realized metrics, plus hints such as `negativeRisk` to help front-ends flag advanced positions.
