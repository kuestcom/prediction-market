Use <code>{ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/traded</code> when you only need a scalar representing how many distinct markets a wallet has touched. The response echoes the `user` plus a `traded` integer.

Because the endpoint is cheap, it works well for profile badges (“traded in N markets”) or gating features such as leaderboards.
