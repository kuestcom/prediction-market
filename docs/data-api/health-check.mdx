export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Ping <code>{ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/</code> to confirm that the service is online. A healthy instance returns `{ "data": "OK" }`; any other HTTP status indicates that the load balancer, the service, or its upstream caches are unhealthy.

## When to call it

- Up-time monitors (Datadog, Better Uptime, etc.)
- Simple readiness probes in CI/CD jobs before running expensive smoke tests
- Local development scripts that need to verify a tunnelled instance is reachable

The route has no authentication or query parameters and responds quickly because it bypasses any database access.
