# Redeem resolved positions

Once a condition is resolved, holders of the winning outcome token can redeem it for collateral 1:1. Redemption is permissionless and final—after the burn, the token balance drops to zero and you receive USDC back on **Polygon Amoy**.

## Resolution requirements

Before calling `redeemPositions` confirm that:

- The oracle has reported the winning outcome and triggered `ConditionResolution` on-chain.
- Your wallet holds the winning `positionId` balance.
- No prior redemption has been processed for the same `(owner, positionId)` pair.

## Contract call

```solidity
conditionalTokens.redeemPositions(
  address(USDC),
  bytes32(conditionId),
  partition,
  winningIndexSet
);
```

- `partition` should include every outcome index set. Only the winning entries are burned.
- `winningIndexSet` is the bitmask that the oracle reported. For binary markets this is either `1` (yes) or `2` (no).

## Handling payouts in your app

1. Subscribe to the `TransferSingle` events emitted by `redeemPositions` to confirm the burn.
2. Update any off-chain ledger to mark the position as settled and move the funds into “available balance.”
3. Use our [relayer APIs](/relayer/core/post-submit) if you need {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} to submit the transaction on behalf of a user who lacks gas on Amoy.

Redeeming is a one-way action, so only call it after you are comfortable with the resolution status published by the oracle.
