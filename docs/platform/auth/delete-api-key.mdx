export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Invalidate a {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} API key so it can no longer authenticate L2 requests.

<Tip>
This endpoint requires the <strong>L2 header</strong>. Provide `KUEST_ADDRESS`, `KUEST_SIGNATURE`, `KUEST_TIMESTAMP`, `KUEST_API_KEY`, and `KUEST_PASSPHRASE`.
</Tip>

## Required headers

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `KUEST_ADDRESS` | Polygon address that owns the credentials. |
| `KUEST_SIGNATURE` | HMAC signature generated with the API secret. |
| `KUEST_TIMESTAMP` | Current Unix timestamp (seconds). |
| `KUEST_API_KEY` | API key being revoked. |
| `KUEST_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase associated with the API key. |

## Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `revoked` | boolean | Indicates whether the provided API key was successfully revoked. |

After revoking, rerun [`GET /auth/api-keys`](/platform/auth/get-api-keys) to confirm it no longer appears. Need a fresh credential later? See [`POST /auth/api-key`](/platform/auth/create-api-key).
