title: 'Derive API key'
openapi: 'GET /auth/derive-api-key'
---


Return deterministic API credentials for an address/nonce pair that already exists. Use this when you previously created a key and want to re-derive it with the same L1 signature payload.

<Tip>
This endpoint requires the <strong>L1 header</strong>. Provide `KUEST_ADDRESS`, `KUEST_SIGNATURE`, `KUEST_TIMESTAMP`, and `KUEST_NONCE`.
</Tip>

## Required headers

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `KUEST_ADDRESS` | Polygon address that controls the wallet signing the request. |
| `KUEST_SIGNATURE` | EIP-712 signature authorizing the derivation. |
| `KUEST_TIMESTAMP` | Current Unix timestamp (seconds). |
| `KUEST_NONCE` | Monotonic nonce tied to the signature. |

If no API key exists for the supplied address/nonce, the request responds with `404`.
