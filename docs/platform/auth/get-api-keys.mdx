## Required headers

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `KUEST_ADDRESS` | Polygon address that owns the credentials. |
| `KUEST_SIGNATURE` | HMAC signature generated with the API secret. |

The array only contains active API key identifiers. Revoked keys are excluded from this response. To retire a key, call [`DELETE /auth/api-key`](/platform/auth/delete-api-key). For UI-based management, open <a href="https://auth.kuest.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">auth.kuest.com</a>.
