# {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} Dev Docs

Welcome to the {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} developer hub. Here you will find everything required to integrate with our Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) services—order book depth, real-time pricing, historical data, and aggregated spreads.

<Info>
All endpoints documented here are powered by our OpenAPI specification. Use the playground on each page to send test requests against <code>{ENV.CLOB_URL ?? 'https://clob.kuest.com'}</code> (CLOB), <code>{ENV.RELAYER_URL ?? 'https://relayer.kuest.com'}</code> (Relayer), or <code>{ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}</code> (Data API).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Token** | Represents exposure to a specific yes/no outcome within a market. Prices float between 0 and 1 to reflect sentiment, and the token tied to the resolved outcome redeems for 1 USDC. Tokens are sometimes referred to as *asset IDs*. |
| **Market** | A single outcome pairing on the CLOB. Each market references two token IDs (yes/no), plus a market address, question ID, and condition ID. |
| **Event** | A collection of closely related markets grouped under a shared topic so traders can find the entire set at once. |
| **Slug** | A human-readable identifier embedded in the URL for a market or event, designed to be easy to reference and share. |
| **Central Limit Order Book** | The off-chain matching engine that processes resting and market orders before any settlement is posted on-chain. |
| **Polygon Network** | The layer-2 blockchain that {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} uses for on-chain lifecycle actions such as contract deployment and token transfers. |
| **Fork** | A copy and adaptation of an open-source project. In {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME}, it refers to creating your own prediction market connected to global liquidity. |
