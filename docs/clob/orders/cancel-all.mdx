title: 'Cancel all orders'
openapi: 'DELETE /cancel-all'
---


Cancel all open orders for the authenticated account.

<Info>
Cancellation requests require L2 authentication headers: `KUEST_ADDRESS`, `KUEST_SIGNATURE`, `KUEST_TIMESTAMP`, `KUEST_API_KEY`, and `KUEST_PASSPHRASE`.
</Info>

The response always returns HTTP `200 OK`. Successful cancellations append the ULIDs to `canceled`. If any order cannot be cancelled, it appears in `not_canceled` with a short reason string.

## Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canceled` | string[] | List of order ULIDs successfully cancelled. |
| `not_canceled` | object | Map of order IDs that were not cancelled to the reason string. |
