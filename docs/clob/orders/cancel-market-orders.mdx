title: 'Cancel market orders'
openapi: 'DELETE /cancel-market-orders'
---


Cancel all open orders for a specific market and/or asset.

<Info>
Cancellation requests require L2 authentication headers: `KUEST_ADDRESS`, `KUEST_SIGNATURE`, `KUEST_TIMESTAMP`, `KUEST_API_KEY`, and `KUEST_PASSPHRASE`.
</Info>

At least one of `market` or `assetId` is required. The response always returns HTTP `200 OK`. Successful cancellations append the ULIDs to `canceled`. If any order cannot be cancelled, it appears in `not_canceled` with a short reason string.
