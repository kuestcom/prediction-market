title: 'Cancel order'
openapi: 'DELETE /order'
---


Cancel a resting order using its ULID. Provide the identifier in the JSON body and the endpoint returns which orders were cancelled as well as any that failed.

<Info>
Cancellation requests also require L2 authentication headers: `KUEST_ADDRESS`, `KUEST_SIGNATURE`, `KUEST_TIMESTAMP`, `KUEST_API_KEY`, and `KUEST_PASSPHRASE`.
</Info>

The response always returns HTTP `200 OK`. Successful cancellations append the ULID to `canceled`. If an order cannot be cancelled, it remains in `not_canceled` with a short reason string. Use [`GET /data/order/{id}`](/clob/orders/get-order) to confirm the terminal status after issuing a cancellation.

## Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canceled` | string[] | List of order ULIDs successfully cancelled. |
| `not_canceled` | object | Map of order IDs that were not cancelled to the reason string. |

### Possible `not_canceled` reasons

- `order not found`
- `order could not be cancelled`
