# Trades overview

Use the trades endpoints to audit fills that executed against your {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} orders. Every response is scoped to the authenticated L2 account, so you only see trades where your wallet or API key participated.

## Authentication

All trade queries require the L2 headers:

- `KUEST_ADDRESS`
- `KUEST_SIGNATURE`
- `KUEST_TIMESTAMP`
- `KUEST_API_KEY`
- `KUEST_PASSPHRASE`

Refer to the [Authentication overview](/api-reference/authentication) for minting credentials.

## Available endpoints

- [`GET /data/trades`](/api-reference/trade/get-trades) — filter and page through trades where your account acted as maker or taker.

Future revisions will add aggregate views and on-chain settlement metadata as those signals become available in the API.
