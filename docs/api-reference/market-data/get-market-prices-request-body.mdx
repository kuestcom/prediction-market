openapi: 'POST /prices'

Query multiple tokens in a single call by submitting an array payload.

## Request payload

Send a JSON array where each object includes:

- `token_id` (required) — string identifier for the market outcome you want to price.
- `side` (optional) — hint for the preferred book edge to evaluate. When you omit this field the service returns both sides automatically. Even when you supply `BUY` or `SELL`, the response still contains prices for both sides so you can compare the spread.

## Response body

The response is an object keyed by the requested `token_id`. Every entry includes `BUY` and `SELL` fields, each holding the latest executable price for that side of the book.

Use the playground controls to test different token lists and confirm how the optional side hint influences pricing.
