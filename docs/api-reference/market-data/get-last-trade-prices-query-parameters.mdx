title: 'Get last trade prices'
openapi: 'POST /last-trades-prices'
---


Retrieve the most recent executed trade price for every `token_id` you include in the request array.

## Request payload

Send a JSON array where each object contains a single required field:

- `token_id` — string identifier for the outcome you want to price.

Submit as many token identifiers as you need; the service responds only for markets with at least one recorded fill.

## Response body

The endpoint returns an array with one object per token that has a recorded trade. Each entry contains:

- `token_id` — identifier echoed back from the request.
- `price` — string-formatted decimal value for the latest execution.
- `side` — `BUY` if the last trade lifted an ask, or `SELL` if it hit a bid.

Use the playground to experiment with different token sets or pair this endpoint with `GET /trades` when you need the full trade history.
