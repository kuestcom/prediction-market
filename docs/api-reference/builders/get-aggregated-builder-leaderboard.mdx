This route aggregates volume, active user counts, and verification indicators for each builder (community curator, partner, etc.). Use it to seed leaderboard tables or badges that recognize high-performing builders.

- `timePeriod`: `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`, or `ALL` (defaults to `DAY`).
- `limit` and `offset` paginate through the ranked list (max 50 per page).

Each object includes the `rank`, `builder` label, `volume`, `activeUsers`, `verified` flag, and optional logo URL.
