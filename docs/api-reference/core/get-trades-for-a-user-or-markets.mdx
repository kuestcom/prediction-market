export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

<code>{ENV.DATA_URL ?? 'https://data-api.kuest.com'}/trades</code> surfaces every fill captured by the {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} orderbook subgraph. You can query by wallet or by a batch of markets.

## Parameters worth noting

- `limit`/`offset` support up to 10,000 rows for heavy exports.
- `takerOnly=true` (default) filters out maker fills; set it to `false` for a complete view.
- Pair `filterType=CASH|TOKENS` with `filterAmount` to return only trades larger than a given notional amount.
- `side` lets you focus on buys or sells when looking at a specific wallet.

The `market` parameter accepts CSV lists and cannot be combined with other future scoping filters.
