Retrieve the latest state for a previously submitted order. The response captures execution progress, timestamps, and any trades already linked to the order. Link back to [`POST /order`](/api-reference/trade/post-a-new-order) to see the payload that generates each ULID, and use [`DELETE /order`](/api-reference/trade/cancel-single-order) if you need to retire the order after inspection.
