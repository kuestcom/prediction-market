export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Submit a new order to the {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} central limit order book. Orders are accepted for matching immediately; validation happens synchronously and the response tells you whether the request was persisted.

<Info>
All order placement calls require the L2 authentication headers: `KUEST_ADDRESS`, `KUEST_SIGNATURE`, `KUEST_TIMESTAMP`, `KUEST_API_KEY`, and `KUEST_PASSPHRASE`. Review how to obtain them in the [`Authentication overview`](/api-reference/authentication) or use the managed console at <a href="https://auth.kuest.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">auth.kuest.com</a>.
</Info>

<Note>
When the global circuit breaker is enabled, this endpoint returns `409` with `{"error":"system_paused"}`. Individually paused books still reply with `409` and `{"error":"condition_paused"}`. Make sure the `owner` field matches the `KUEST_ADDRESS` header; otherwise the API returns `400` and `{"error":"owner_address_mismatch"}`.
</Note>

## Placement status

Order submissions respond with a `status` field:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `live` | Order accepted and resting on the book. |
| `error` | Order rejected; see `errorMsg` for details. |


## Request body

### Root fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `owner` | string | Yes | Polygon address that owns the API key. Must match the `KUEST_ADDRESS` header. |
| `orderType` | string | Yes | Time-in-force policy for the order (`FOK`, `FAK`, `GTC`, `GTD`). |
| `postOnly` | boolean | No | When true, the order must rest on the book (GTC/GTD only). |
| `order` | object | Yes | Full order payload described below. |

<Note>
For `GTD` orders you must supply an `order.expiration` in the future. `GTC`, `FAK`, and `FOK` may omit `expiration`; the engine simply ignores the value when it is not needed.
</Note>

### `order` object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tokenId` | string | Yes | Identifier of the token/outcome being traded. |
| `conditionId` | string | Yes | Market condition identifier tied to the token. |
| `expiration` | string | Conditional | Unix timestamp (seconds) when the order becomes invalid. Required for `GTD`, optional otherwise. |
| `maker` | string | Yes | Address that holds the asset being offered. |
| `signer` | string | Yes | Address that produced the signature authorizing the order. |
| `taker` | string | Yes | Counterparty address. Use the zero address for open orders. |
| `makerAmount` | string | Yes | Quantity provided by the maker, denominated with fixed precision. |
| `takerAmount` | string | Yes | Quantity expected from the taker. Must stay within allowed tick sizes. |
| `side` | string | Yes | Either `BUY` or `SELL`. |
| `metadata` | object\|null | No | Optional JSON metadata stored with the order. |
| `nonce` | string | Yes | Monotonic value chosen by the maker to guard against reuse. |
| `feeRateBps` | string | Yes | Maker fee rate in basis points. |
| `salt` | string | Yes | Unique entropy for replay protection. Reuse causes duplicate rejection. |
| `signatureType` | number | Yes | `0` = EOA, `1` = proxy signer, `2` = Gnosis Safe signer. |
| `signature` | string | Yes | Hex-encoded signature produced over the order payload. |

<Note>
When the exchange enforces a minimum fee, `feeRateBps` must be greater than or equal to the base fee returned by [`GET /fee-rate`](/api-reference/market-data/get-fee-rate) for the same `tokenId`.
</Note>

<Info>
All fixed-precision numeric values (`makerAmount`, `takerAmount`, `nonce`, `feeRateBps`, `expiration`) must be sent as strings to avoid precision issues during parsing. `side` must be the uppercase string `BUY` or `SELL`. `owner` must match the `KUEST_ADDRESS` header supplied with the request.
</Info>



### Order types

| **Type** | **Partial fills?** | **Rests on the book?** | **Auto expiration?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FOK** (Fill-Or-Kill) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Immediately if not 100% filled |
| **FAK** (Fill-And-Kill / IOC) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Any remaining size cancels right away |
| **GTC** (Good-Til-Cancelled) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes, until cancelled | ❌ No |
| **GTD** (Good-Til-Date) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes, until the given timestamp | ✅ At the specified expiration time |

For `GTD`, the engine enforces a one-minute safety buffer. If you need the order to expire in 90 seconds, set `expiration = now + 90 + 60`.

## Execution and follow-up

- A successful placement returns `200 OK` with `success: true`.
- `orderID` is the order identifier for tracking. Use [`GET /data/order/{id}`](/api-reference/trade/get-single-order-by-id) to check final status and filled amounts.
- Need to retire a resting order? Call [`DELETE /order`](/api-reference/trade/cancel-single-order).

Order status values returned by `GET /data/order/{id}` are:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `open` | Order is resting on the book. |
| `partially_filled` | Order remains on the book with some fills. |
| `filled` | Order fully executed. |
| `cancelled` | Order removed. For IOC/FAK, partial fills still return `cancelled` with non-zero filled amounts. |
