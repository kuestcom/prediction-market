# Negative risk markets

{ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} occasionally deploys *winner-take-all* events as **negative risk** structures. In these setups, every market inside the event references the same collateral pool, so a `NO` share in one market can be turned into a `YES` share in every other market. The mechanism is enabled on **Polygon Amoy** first, mirroring production layouts before we go live.

Our APIs expose the `negRisk` boolean at the event level. When it is `true`, make sure your app understands the conversion logic described below.

## Why negative risk exists

- **Capital efficiency** — Liquidity providers can price many correlated markets with the same collateral rather than locking funds per market.
- **Consistent resolution** — Because the markets share a pool, only one of them can resolve positively. The convert action enforces this invariant.
- **Simpler hedging** — Traders can move into or out of exposure without bridging assets; they convert across markets in a single on-chain call.

## Convert flow

Conversions are routed through the Negative Risk Adapter contract. To exercise it:

1. Approve the adapter to spend your outcome tokens.
2. Call the adapter’s `convert` method, specifying the event, market you are exiting, and the destination market.
3. Receive the equivalent `YES` balance in the target market; your `NO` tokens are burned so the invariant holds.

{ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} exposes the adapter ABI and address alongside every negative-risk event announcement. Until the mainnet release, rely on the Amoy deployment shared in those announcements.

## Augmented negative risk

Some events need room for unnamed outcomes that may appear later. In those cases we enable **augmented negative risk** by setting both `enableNegRisk = true` and `negRiskAugmented = true`.

- Named outcomes are meant for trading.
- Placeholder outcomes (for example, `Participant A`, `Participant B`) can later be clarified through our bulletin board. Do not trade them unless they become fully specified.
- The explicit `Other` outcome only resolves if the winning scenario was never given a dedicated market.

When augmented negative risk is active, conversions should still ignore placeholder tokens until they have been clarified. The {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} UI hides them automatically, but third-party front ends should apply the same rule.

## Detecting support through APIs

- [Data API](/api-reference/core/get-top-holders-for-markets) — The `negRisk` and `negRiskAugmented` flags are present on event payloads.
- [Subgraphs](/market-data/subgraph) — Query the metadata entity for `enableNegRisk` to show conversion controls.
- Relayer — Convert transactions can be sent through the relayer like any other Safe call if your user lacks gas on Amoy.

If you are unsure whether a historical market supported negative risk, check the event payload in the Data API or scan the Amoy subgraph for adapter interactions tied to that `conditionId`.
