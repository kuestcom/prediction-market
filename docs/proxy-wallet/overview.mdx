# Proxy wallet (Amoy)

When a builder signs into {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} tooling for the first time, we deterministically deploy a 1-of-1 Safe proxy on **Polygon Amoy**. That contract becomes the canonical holder of the user’s ERC-1155 outcome tokens and USDC balances, letting us batch settlement steps and relay every transaction with predictable gas.

Proxy wallets help us keep UX simple: multi-call bundles stay atomic, relayers can pay gas on behalf of users, and you can interact with your inventory programmatically through the Safe once it exists.

## Core addresses

| Contract | Amoy address | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safe Proxy factory | `0x0202c1c426C77cEE55979e4fB3496288fAba8413` | Default deployment path for every login provider; used whenever a user’s Safe needs to be created or upgraded. |
| Proxy Factory | `0xc70A03a24424d934D7bd7E43de48e2Dafcc0Fe02` | Legacy factory kept for backward compatibility; currently not used by any Amoy workflow. |

<Info>
Every user still ends up with their own Safe proxy. The factory above emits deterministic deployments (CREATE2), so you can pre-compute wallet addresses from the owner EOA before actually submitting any transaction.

## Programmatic control

1. Retrieve the deterministic proxy address by hashing the owner, factory, and initializer. The relayer endpoints already expose helpers for this.
2. Sign transactions locally using the Safe transaction hash rules. Keep the payload ready whether you plan to submit it yourself or via [`POST /core/post-submit`](/relayer/core/post-submit).
3. Poll [`GET /core/get-transactions`](/relayer/core/get-transactions) for status updates whenever {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} broadcasts on your behalf.

## Legacy proxy factory

The custom {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} Proxy Factory remains deployed on Amoy so historical wallets can still be replayed, but **it is not part of any active login or onboarding path today**. Safe proxies fully cover both MetaMask-style EOAs and embedded wallets, which keeps the surface area smaller and simplifies audits. Keep the factory address handy only if you run archival tasks or migrate very old accounts.
