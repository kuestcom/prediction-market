## Crypto Wallet Sign-Up

{ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} also supports direct sign-up using a crypto wallet.
Popular wallets such as **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Binance Wallet** are supported through **Reown (formerly WalletConnect)**.

<Info>
When you connect with a wallet, your funds remain **fully in your control** — they are never held by {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME}.

## Tips

- If you have MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet browser extensions installed but wish to connect using their mobile apps,
  you may need to **disable the browser extension** and reload the page.
- You can always switch between login methods later if needed.
