## What is Market Resolution?

Each market eventually resolves to a final outcome — either **Yes**, **No**, or one of the listed choices.
Resolution determines which traders win and which lose.

## How Resolution Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event concludes">

    The real-world condition tied to the market is finished (for example, polls
    close, earnings call completes, or the deadline passes).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome reported">

    Trusted sources and on-chain oracles feed the outcome into
    {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME}. Moderators confirm accuracy and flag
    any disputes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market status updates">

    The market flips to <strong>Resolved</strong>; winning shares become
    claimable and non-winning shares expire worth zero.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resolution Timelines

- Most markets resolve within a few hours after the event concludes.
- Some may take longer if the outcome is unclear or awaiting official confirmation.
- The resolution timestamp appears directly in the market page.
