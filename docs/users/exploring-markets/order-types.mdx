## Types of Orders

{ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} supports two primary order types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Market orders">
    Execute immediately at the best available price in the order book. Choose
    this when you value speed and certainty of execution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limit orders">
    Set the exact price you are willing to pay or accept. The order remains
    open until another trader matches it, making limits ideal for precise
    pricing or larger trades.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
