    other available outcome you want to back.

    Submit a <strong>Market</strong> order to fill immediately, or a
    <strong>Limit</strong> order to specify your price and wait for a match.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm purchase">

    Enter the USDC amount you want to invest, review the fee and expected
    payout, then confirm. Your shares appear in your <strong>Portfolio</strong>
    instantly.

## Selling Shares

You can sell your shares at any time before resolution:

- Sell via **Market Order** to exit instantly
- Place a **Limit Order** to try to sell at a better price

When the market resolves, all remaining shares are automatically settled based on the winning outcome.
