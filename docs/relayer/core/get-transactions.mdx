title: 'List relayer transactions'
openapi: 'GET /transactions'
---
export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Inspect every transaction the authenticated account has submitted to the relayer. The feed covers Safe deployments, Safe executions, and ProxyWallet relays along with their current state and hashes.

<Info>
Call <code>{ENV.RELAYER_URL ?? 'https://relayer.kuest.com'}/transactions</code> with the standard L2 headers. The relayer derives the account from your credentials and automatically scopes the response.

| `transactionHash` | string | On-chain transaction hash when broadcast. |
| `from` | string | Source address (Safe owner or Proxy wallet). |
| `to` | string | Destination contract. |
| `proxyAddress` | string | Proxy wallet executing the call, when applicable. |
| `data` | string | 0x-encoded calldata sent on-chain. |
| `nonce` | string | Decimal nonce used by the relayer. |
| `value` | string | Amount of wei forwarded with the call. |
| `state` | string | Current lifecycle state such as `STATE_ACCEPTED`, `STATE_MINED`, or `STATE_FAILED`. |

- Results are returned in descending `createdAt` order; use client-side filtering for pagination.
- Only the authenticated account may access its history. Requests with mismatched headers respond with `403`.
- When a transaction is still pending, `transactionHash` may be `null` until the relayer broadcasts it.
