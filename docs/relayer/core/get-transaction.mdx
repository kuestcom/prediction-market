title: 'Get relayer transaction'
openapi: 'GET /transaction'
---
export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Fetch a single relayer transaction by `transactionID`. This endpoint is handy when polling for status updates without downloading the whole history feed.

<Info>
Send the request to <code>{ENV.RELAYER_URL ?? 'https://relayer.kuest.com'}/transaction</code> and include the same L2 headers required by the other relayer endpoints. Only transactions owned by the authenticated address are returned.

## Query parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Yes | ULID returned by `/submit` or `/transactions`. |

## Notes

- When no transaction matches the supplied `id`, you receive an empty array and HTTP 200.
- `state` progresses through `STATE_ACCEPTED`, `STATE_BROADCAST`, and `STATE_MINED`; failed submissions reply with `STATE_REJECTED` alongside an error property.
- The relayer enforces ownership; querying someone else’s transaction returns an empty list.
