title: 'Submit relayer transaction'
openapi: 'POST /submit'
---
export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Send a signed Safe execution (`SAFE`), Safe deployment (`SAFE-CREATE`), or proxy relay (`PROXY`) to the {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} relayer. The payload mirrors the structures generated by the builder relayer client library, and the relayer persists it before broadcasting the corresponding transaction on-chain.

<Info>
Post to <code>{ENV.RELAYER_URL ?? 'https://relayer.kuest.com'}/submit</code> using the same L2 headers used for CLOB requests. The relayer verifies that the `from` address (and Safe owner) matches your authenticated account before queuing the transaction.

## Request body

### Root fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Yes | Operation type. `SAFE` (execution), `SAFE-CREATE` (deployment), or `PROXY` (proxy relay). |
| `from` | string | Yes | Safe owner or signer submitting the request. Must equal `KUEST_ADDRESS`. |
| `to` | string | Yes | Contract executed by the Safe or proxy wallet. |
| `proxyWallet` | string | Conditional | Proxy address executing the call. Required for `SAFE` and `PROXY` operations. |
| `data` | string | Yes | 0x-prefixed calldata for the transaction. |
| `nonce` | string | Conditional | Required for `SAFE` and `PROXY`. Optional for `SAFE-CREATE` (the relayer assigns the next nonce when omitted). |
| `value` | string | No | Amount of wei to forward. Defaults to `"0"`. |
| `signature` | string | Yes | Signature covering the transaction. |
| `signatureParams` | object | Yes | Gas, refund, and payment metadata described below. |
| `metadata` | string\|null | No | Optional label stored alongside the transaction. |

### `signatureParams`

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operation` | string | Conditional | `SAFE` only. Operation code (`0` = CALL, `1` = DELEGATECALL). |
| `safeTxnGas` | string | Conditional | `SAFE` only. Safe gas limit for the execution. |
| `baseGas` | string | Conditional | `SAFE` only. Extra gas charged for refunds. |
| `gasPrice` | string | Conditional | `SAFE` and `PROXY`. Gas price used in signature data. |
| `gasToken` | string | Conditional | `SAFE` only. Token in which the refund is paid (`0x0` for native). |
| `refundReceiver` | string | Conditional | `SAFE` only. Address receiving the refund. |
| `gasLimit` | string | Conditional | `PROXY` only. Relay gas limit used in the proxy signature. |
| `relayerFee` | string | Conditional | `PROXY` only. Relay fee used in the proxy signature. |
| `relayHub` | string | Conditional | `PROXY` only. Relay hub address used in the proxy signature. |
| `relay` | string | Conditional | `PROXY` only. Relay address used in the proxy signature. |
| `paymentToken` | string | Conditional | `SAFE-CREATE` only. Mirrors the deploy builder payload. |
| `payment` | string | Conditional | `SAFE-CREATE` only. Amount charged for deployment. |
| `paymentReceiver` | string | Conditional | `SAFE-CREATE` only. Recipient of the deployment payment. |

<Note>
`SAFE-CREATE` submissions follow the builder client schema exactly, including initialization calldata and the payment fields listed above. `safeTxnGas` is accepted as `safeTxGas` for compatibility with older payloads.
</Note>

## Behavior and errors

- Requests are validated immediately. Schema issues return `400` with details about the invalid field.
- Duplicate nonces are rejected with `409 conflict`; fetch a fresh nonce and resubmit if the previous attempt succeeded.
- For `PROXY`, call [`GET /relay-payload`](/relayer/core/get-relay-payload) to fetch the relay address and nonce before signing.
- The endpoint returns `transactionID` even before the transaction is mined. Use [`GET /transaction`](/relayer/core/get-transaction) to poll for state changes.
- When the relayer cannot broadcast on-chain, it transitions the stored record to `STATE_FAILED` and exposes the RPC error via `GET /transaction`.
