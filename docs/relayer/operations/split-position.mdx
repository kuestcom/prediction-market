title: 'Relayer split position'
openapi: 'POST /operations/split-position'
---
export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Ask the relayer to call `splitPosition` on Conditional Tokens, transforming collateral into outcome tokens for the provided condition and partition.

<Info>
POST to <code>{ENV.RELAYER_URL ?? 'https://relayer.kuest.com'}/operations/split-position</code> with the same L2 authentication headers. The relayer broadcasts the signed Safe transaction; execution happens from the Safe proxy.
</Info>

## Request body

`split-position` accepts the same payload as [`POST /submit`](/relayer/core/post-submit). Use:

- `type`: `SAFE`
- `proxyWallet`: Safe address executing the call
- `to`: Conditional Tokens contract address
- `data`: ABI-encoded `splitPosition(...)` calldata

All other fields (`from`, `nonce`, `signature`, `signatureParams`, `value`, `metadata`) follow the `/submit` schema.

## Notes

- Ensure the Safe holds the collateral and has approved the Conditional Tokens contract to transfer it.
- The `nonce` must match `GET /nonce` with `type=SAFE`; mismatches return `409`.
- The relayer enforces deterministic casing and 0x prefixes for all identifier fields; malformed values return `400`.
- Outcome tokens are minted to the Safe (`proxyWallet`) that executed the call.
