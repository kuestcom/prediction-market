title: 'Relayer redeem position'
openapi: 'POST /operations/redeem-position'
---
export const ENV = globalThis.process?.env ?? {}

Redeem resolved outcome tokens for collateral by having the relayer call `redeemPositions`. This is typically the final step once a market has been settled on-chain.

<Info>
POST to <code>{ENV.RELAYER_URL ?? 'https://relayer.kuest.com'}/operations/redeem-position</code> with the usual L2 headers. You will receive the relayer-broadcast hash and confirmations for the Safe execution.
</Info>

## Request body

`redeem-position` accepts the same payload as [`POST /submit`](/relayer/core/post-submit). Use:

- `type`: `SAFE`
- `proxyWallet`: Safe address executing the call
- `to`: Conditional Tokens contract address
- `data`: ABI-encoded `redeemPositions(...)` calldata

All other fields (`from`, `nonce`, `signature`, `signatureParams`, `value`, `metadata`) follow the `/submit` schema.

## Notes

- Ensure the outcomes have resolved; otherwise the Safe transaction will revert.
- The `nonce` must match `GET /nonce` with `type=SAFE`; mismatches return `409`.
- Collateral is paid out to the Safe (`proxyWallet`) that executed the call.
- Validation failures (bad hex, missing fields) return `400`. Execution issues surface as `502` with the RPC error appended to `error`.
