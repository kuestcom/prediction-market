# Split USDC into outcome positions

Splitting collateral produces a pair of ERC-1155 outcome tokens that represent the possible answers to a market question. On **Polygon Amoy**, this flow mirrors production so you can rehearse every allowance and signature step before promoting to mainnet.

## Prerequisites

1. Hold testnet USDC on Amoy. You can mint from the [official faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/).
2. Approve the ConditionalTokens contract for the total amount you plan to split.
3. Know the `conditionId` and the integer index set for the outcome you want to mint.

## Contract call

Call `splitPosition(collateralToken, conditionId, partition, amount)` where:

- `collateralToken` is Amoy USDC.
- `conditionId` is the 32-byte identifier you created via the oracle.
- `partition` is `[1, 2]` for binary markets (yes/no). Multisided markets should pass more index sets.
- `amount` is the collateral (in wei) to convert.

```solidity
uint256[] memory partition = new uint256[](2);
partition[0] = 1; // yes
partition[1] = 2; // no

conditionalTokens.splitPosition(
  address(USDC),
  bytes32(conditionId),
  partition,
  amount
);
```

After the transaction confirms, you now hold ERC-1155 balances for each `positionId`. These balances can be deposited into the {ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} CLOB or pooled inside an FPMM.

## Operational tips

- Always log the `ConditionCreated` and `PositionSplit` events emitted on Amoy so your backend remains in lockstep with on-chain IDs.
- When batching multiple splits, increment allowances rather than re-approving for every call; Polygon gas costs favor fewer approvals.
- Splitting is reversible: you can `mergePositions` at any time before resolution to recover the original collateral 1:1 (minus gas).
